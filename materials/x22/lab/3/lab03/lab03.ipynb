    "[K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/17/1/Nearest_Neighbors.html) is a classification algorithm.  Given some numerical *attributes* (also called *features*) of an unseen example, it decides which category that example belongs to based on its similarity to previously seen examples.

    "In k-NN, we classify a movie by finding the `k` movies in the *training set* that are most similar according to the features we choose. We call those movies with similar features the *nearest neighbors*.  The k-NN algorithm assigns the movie to the most common category among its `k` nearest neighbors.\n",

    "Let's limit ourselves to just 2 features for now, so we can plot each movie.  The features we will use are the proportions of the words \"water\" and \"feel\" in the movie.  Taking the movie *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* (in the test set), 0.000804074 of its words are \"water\" and 0.0010721 are \"feel\". This movie appears in the test set, so let's imagine that we don't yet know its genre.\n",

Its distance from *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* on this 2-word feature set is $\\sqrt{(0.000804074 - 0.000162933)^2 + (0.0010721 - 0.00154786)^2} \\approx 0.000798379$.

As you can see in the result, *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* is more similar to *Clerks.* than to the *The Godfather* based on these features, which makes sense as both movies are comedy movies, while *The Godfather* is a thriller."
