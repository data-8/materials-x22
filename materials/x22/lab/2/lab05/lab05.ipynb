These temperatures were not actually sampled at random\u2014instead they occurred due to the complex interactions of the Earth's climate\u2014but treating them as if they were random abstracts away the details of this naturally occuring process and allows us to carry out statistical inference.

In all months, the sample average we will consider (i.e. the `Present` value in our `monthly_increases` table) is larger than the historical average.
