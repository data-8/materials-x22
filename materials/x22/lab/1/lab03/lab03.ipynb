    "So far, we've used Python to manipulate numbers and work with tables. But we need to discuss data types to deepen our understanding of how to work with data in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll first see how to represent and manipulate another fundamental type of data: text.  A piece of text is called a *string* in Python. You'll also see how to work with *arrays* of data. An array could contain all the numbers between 0 and 100 or all the words in the chapter of a book. Lastly, you'll create tables and practice analyzing them with your knowledge of table operations. The [Python Reference](http://data8.org/python-reference/python-reference.html) has information that will be useful for this lab.\n"

    "Here is one simple question we might ask about world population:\n",

    "> How big was the population in each year, rounded to the nearest million?\n",

    "Rounding is often used with large numbers when we don't need as much precision in our numbers. One example of this is when we present data in tables and visualizations. \n",

    "We could try to answer our question using the `round` function that is built into Python and the `item` method you just saw. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** the `round` function takes in two arguments: the number to be rounded, and the number of decimal places to round to. The second argument can be thought of as how many steps right or left you move from the decimal point. Negative numbers tell us to move left, and positive numbers tell us to move right. So, if we have `round(1234.5, -2)`, it means that we should move two places left, and then make all numbers to the right of this place zeroes. This would output the number 1200.0. On the other hand, if we have `round(6.789, 1)`, we should move one place right, and then make all numbers to the right of this place zeroes. This would output the number 6.8."
