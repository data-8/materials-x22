    "Hopefully the icon arrays from the previous portion helped you build intuition for why conditional probabilities can be helpful. Now, let\u2019s look at a real life application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Medical testing is very important, especially for cancer. A basic cancer screening involves looking for cancer before a person has any symptoms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cancer screening is not 100% reliable, and it can have errors. There are cases in which someone without cancer or with a benign tumor sees a positive test result. There are also cases where someone with cancer can receive a negative result. (\u201cPositive\u201d implies an indication of cancer in this context.) The first case, called a false positive, could cause anxiety for a patient and lead to further testing that may be risky and involve unnecessary radiation. In the second case, called a false negative, a person would not receive the necessary information and possible treatment for their condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability can provide insight into the accuracy of initial cancer tests. For example, you can compute the chance that a person has cancer given the results of a diagnostic test by combining information from different probability distributions. You\u2019ll see that the chance Person X does have cancer even if they receive a positive result is not necessarily 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that conditional probabilities offer just one line of insight to understanding a test result and that this statistical approach does not take into account important factors like heredity or environment that come to affect a person\u2019s health and diagnoses. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/prevention/screening.htm) (CDC) recommends getting preventative cancer screenings, and one should always consult a doctor if they are concerned about their health.

    "Being right isn\u2019t always satisfying. Classifying a Positive patient as not having cancer still seems somehow wrong, for such an accurate test. In this section, we'll take a deeper look at the basis of our probability calculation: the assumption of randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our assumption was that a randomly chosen person was tested from our population of 10,000 individuals. This doesn\u2019t happen in reality. People go in to get tested because they think they might have the disease, or because their doctor thinks they might have the disease. People getting tested are not randomly chosen members of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why our intuition about people getting tested was not fitting well with the answer that we got. In **Question 3.2.2**, we calculated that the probability of cancer given a positive test result was **0.3125**, or **31.25%**. This seems unusually low, especially given what we know about the efficacy of cancer screenings. We were imagining a realistic situation of a patient going in to get tested because there was some reason for them to do so, whereas the calculation was based on a randomly chosen person being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let\u2019s redo our calculation under the more realistic assumption that the patient is getting tested because the doctor thinks there\u2019s a chance the patient has the disease and compare the two probabilities.\n",
    "\n",

    "Suppose now that our population of 10,000 inviduals takes into account the fact that choosing to take a medical test is not done at random; there must be some motive for an individual to take one. Thus, our modified population has the following properties:\n",
    "1. 1,000 people have cancer.\n",
    "1. Among the 1,000 people that have cancer, 900 have positive results on a cancer test and 100 have negative results. \n",
    "3. The other 9,000 people don't have cancer.\n",
    "4. Among these 9,000 people, 180 have positive results on a cancer test and the other 8,820 have negative results.  (So 180 see \"false positive\" results.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we've generated a population table called `people_new` and a contingency table with data from these 10,000 hypothetical people called `cancer_new`."
